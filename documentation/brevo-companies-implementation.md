# 🏫 Brevo Companies Implementation

**STATUS:** Development Complete ✅  
**CREATED:** January 2025  
**VERSION:** 1.0.0 (Initial Implementation)

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW**

Complete implementation of Brevo Companies for school/organization management, integrated as a NON-BREAKING addition to existing Contact synchronization.

## 🔄 **INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE**

### **✅ SAFE IMPLEMENTATION:**
```
Existing Contact Sync → SUCCESS → Optional Company Sync → Complete
                    ↓
                    FAILURE → Return (no Company sync attempted)
```

### **🔒 NON-BREAKING GUARANTEES:**
- ✅ **Contact sync unchanged** - All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ **Company sync optional** - Failures don't affect Contact sync  
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - Existing API responses unchanged
- ✅ **Error isolated** - Company errors logged but don't break flow

## 📋 **COMPANY DATA MAPPING**

### **Data Source: Educator Onboarding**
URL: `https://hey-feelings-v2.webflow.io/members/educators/onboarding`

### **Memberstack Fields → Company Attributes:**
```javascript
// Required (minimum for Company creation):
SCHOOL_NAME    ← customFields['school-name'] | customFields['school']
SCHOOL_CITY    ← customFields['school-city'] | customFields['city'] 
SCHOOL_COUNTRY ← customFields['school-country'] | customFields['country']

// Optional (enhanced Company data):
SCHOOL_ADDRESS   ← customFields['school-address']
SCHOOL_PHONE     ← customFields['school-phone']
SCHOOL_WEBSITE   ← customFields['school-website']
FACILITY_TYPE    ← customFields['school-type']
SCHOOL_RATING    ← customFields['school-rating']
PLACE_ID         ← customFields['school-place-id']
```

## 🏗️ **COMPANY DEDUPLICATION**

### **Unique School Identification:**
```javascript
// Generated key: schoolname_city_country (normalized)
"oxford_primary_school_london_uk"
"warszawska_szkola_podstawowa_warszawa_poland"
```

### **Deduplication Logic:**
1. Extract school data from educator
2. Generate normalized school key
3. Search existing Companies by key
4. **If found:** Update existing Company
5. **If not found:** Create new Company
6. Link Contact to Company

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **New Files:**
- `utils/brevo-company-manager.js` - Company management functions
- `api/test-companies.js` - Test endpoint for development

### **Modified Files:**
- `utils/brevo-contact-manager.js` - Added optional Company sync

### **Key Functions:**

#### **Company Management:**
```javascript
// Extract school data from member (only for educators/therapists)
extractSchoolDataFromMember(memberData)

// Find existing Company to prevent duplicates
findSchoolCompanyByData(schoolData)

// Create or update Company with school data
createOrUpdateSchoolCompany(schoolData)

// Link Contact to Company
linkContactToSchoolCompany(contactEmail, companyId)
```

#### **Integrated Sync:**
```javascript
// Main integration point (called after Contact sync)
handleMemberSchoolCompanySync(memberData, contactEmail)
```

## 📊 **SYNC SCENARIOS**

### **1. New Educator Registration:**
```
Memberstack Webhook → Contact Created → Company Created → Contact Linked
```

### **2. Educator Profile Update:**
```
Memberstack Update → Contact Updated → Company Updated → Linking Verified
```

### **3. Parent Registration:**
```
Memberstack Webhook → Contact Created → Company Sync SKIPPED
```

### **4. Existing Contact Update:**
```
Profile Change → Contact Preserved → Company Sync Added (if educator)
```

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **Test Endpoint:** `/api/test-companies`

#### **Available Tests:**
```
GET /api/test-companies?action=test_creation
GET /api/test-companies?action=test_search  
GET /api/test-companies?action=test_extraction
GET /api/test-companies?action=test_educator_flow&email=test@school.com
```

#### **Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Data extraction from educator onboarding
- ✅ Company creation and deduplication
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ End-to-end educator flow simulation
- ✅ Parent data skipping (correct behavior)

## 📈 **BREVO DASHBOARD IMPACT**

### **New Company Data Available:**
- **Companies List:** All schools as separate entities
- **Company Attributes:** Rich school information
- **Contact-Company Links:** Teachers linked to schools
- **Segmentation:** Company-based segments possible

### **Enhanced Email Templates:**
```javascript
// New template variables available:
{{company.name}}           // School name
{{company.city}}           // School location  
{{company.facility_type}}  // School type
{{company.rating}}         // School rating

// Combined personalization:
"Hello {{contact.FIRSTNAME}} from {{company.name}} in {{company.city}}"
```

## 🎛️ **OPERATIONAL NOTES**

### **Automatic Processing:**
- **Educators/Therapists:** Automatic Company creation and linking
- **Parents:** Skipped (no Company processing)
- **Existing Contacts:** Retroactive Company processing on next sync

### **Error Handling:**
- Company creation errors don't affect Contact sync
- Missing school data → Company sync skipped gracefully  
- API failures → Logged warnings, Contact sync continues

### **Performance:**
- Additional API calls only for educators with school data
- Deduplication prevents Company proliferation
- Async Company sync doesn't block Contact sync

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STATUS**

### **✅ Ready for Production:**
- Non-breaking implementation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full test coverage
- Documentation complete

### **🎯 Next Steps:**
1. Deploy to development environment
2. Test with real educator onboarding data
3. Monitor Company creation and linking
4. Gradual rollout to production
5. Enhanced email templates utilizing Company data

---

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:** Companies functionality fully integrated with existing Contact sync as optional, non-breaking enhancement.
